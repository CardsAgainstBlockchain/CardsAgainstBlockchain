Cards Against Blockchain
==========================

Cards Against Blockchain is based on Cards Against Cryptography, which described itself as "a party game for horrible people".  Cards Against Blockchain is not quite as mean, but still has bit of an edge.  We are big fans of the cryptographic community, and hope this game is played in a spirit of fun.  But if you don't like crude or offensive humor, this game may not be for you.

Basic Rules
-----------

Each player draws 7 white cards.

The person who most recently had a paper rejected begins as the Session Chair and picks a black card.  The Session Chair reads the black card aloud and shows it to everyone.

Every other player picks 1 white card they think completes the black card best, and submits their white card face down to the Session Chair.

The Session Chair executes a mixnet protocol, and reads aloud each card combination (black + white).  The Session Chair picks the combination they think is funniest; whoever submitted it wins the black card.

After the round, the next player becomes Session Chair.  Everyone draws back up to 7 white cards.

At any time, a player may trade in 1 of their black cards to discard as many white cards as they would like and draw back up to 7.  A player with no black cards can trade up to 3 white cards at most once per game.

The first player to win 5 black cards is declared the winner and awarded tenure.
